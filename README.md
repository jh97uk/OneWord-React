### üëã One Word - An introduction

  

This was a project I began on the 4th of July as a part of my drive to get back into programming as a hobby.

  

In the weeks following, I've been hard at work to make it fully functional

  

The goal of the game simple:

* You create a "story" with a prompt title

* You can then share a link to the story with a friend or (if the game is public), wait for someone to join your story through the matchmaking system

* Once you have someone to play with, all players in the game begin to craft a story, 1 word each

  

This can lead to some pretty funny and amusing stories.

  

### üñ•Ô∏è Technologies

  

For the frontend of this project, I utilized **React** and **FeathersJS**.

  

#### Why React?

  

I decided on React because it's by far my most familiar web development library for the frontend. I feel very comfortable and able with this library, so it seemed like the perfect fit for this concept. It also felt like the best library to use for quickly putting something together.

  

#### Why FeathersJS?

  

Feathers JS is a project I've always wanted to have a play with. It seemed like a really nice way to quickly build applications based off of realtime data, which obviously, with words being sent to and from the server has been key. I'm glad I chose it, it's proven to be very light weight, and not too overwhelming. It has allowed me to quickly throw together an API without getting too bogged down in the minutiae that building APIs causes.

  

### üî® Setup
Running the frontend for OneWord should be pretty simple.

  

`npm start` will suffice, and so long as the backend is running, it will run fine.

  

### üìù End notes
Some quick final notes, this project is more or less finished. I do plan on putting it onto a server in the near future once I've got my Mac build up and running so I can debug a few iOS specific issues. That being said, I'm not entirely happy with the code base just yet. I feel like I have a pretty nice setup going, but I'm not happy with the names of some classes and variables.
